**Do I look good enough to win? Gender and electoral success**

Abstract: A part of the investigation of electoral results in political economy affirms that physical appearance influences the evaluation that voters make, and therefore, can influence their votes, but that this evaluation is not the same for male candidates as for women. This paper analyzes the influence of dominance, beauty, and the emotions reflected by candidates on the behavior of voters in municipal elections in Colombia from a gender perspective. Taking 3 local elections and information from almost 14,000 candidates, the main findings are: having a dominant face increases the percentage of votes for male candidates more than for women, while beauty influences more the votes they receive in female candidates, and that showing happiness is important for both genders, while showing anger is only significant for men. The results suggest that physical appearance does matter in politics


**What do I really care about? Gender stereotypes and government issues**[In progress]

The idea is to identify, through the mayoral candidates' manifestos in Colombia, whether men and women are interested in different public policy issues and whether those topics reinforce traditional gender stereotypes.
